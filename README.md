# 📕 MATH1064
## ❓ What is this?
These are my MATH1064 notes and the LaTeX source code. I cannot guarantee that these notes are absolutely correct or
up to date. I've simply wrote these notes for myself in a way that I can understand and at a time where I'm bothered
to study. Thus, they may not be best method for studying for you. 

### 💡 Can I use these notes?
Sure mate, go for it, it's not like I invented math. You can modify and copy anything you want inside my notes
without my permission, after all I made these notes as revision for myself.

### 📝 How to access?
Simply download the [pdf file](<./MATH1064 Notes.pdf>) and view it or compile it yourself 
using LaTeX by downloading the repository. <br>
