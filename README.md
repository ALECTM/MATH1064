# MATH1064
These are my MATH1064 notes and the LaTeX source code. You may freely modify anything without my permission.
Also, I can't guarantee if they are absolutely correct, I've simply made these notes for myself in a way
that I can understand.

Happy studying! It's always better to practice questions to review
than just simply reading.

### How to access?
Simply download the [pdf file](<./MATH1064 Notes.pdf>) and view it or compile it yourself 
using LaTeX by downloading the repository.
